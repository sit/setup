This is a simple bash script to aid users with the git and GitHub setup process.  It will do a few things:

* Set values in your global git config:
** user.name
** user.email (used by GitHub to match commits to their author)
** github.user & github.token (used by third-party apps that interact with GitHub and Gist)
* Help you create a new ssh key if one is not found
* Upload your public ssh key to your GitHub account
* Ensure ssh-agent loads for msysgit users

This script has been tested on OS X Snow Leopard, Msysgit and Ubuntu 8.04.  You must have git installed before you run this script.  On Linux, you must ensure that curl is installed; for example, if you are using Ubuntu/Debian, by running @sudo apt-get install curl@.

h2. Downloading and running the script

<pre>$ git clone git://github.com/help/setup.git
$ setup/setup.sh
GitHub username not found, please enter: tekkub
GitHub token not found in global git config
Please enter GitHub password for tekkub (this will not be saved):
Fetching API token
Saving GitHub token to global git config
Enter git committer name (return to use 'tekkub'):
Enter git committer email (return to use 'tekkub@gmail.com'):
No id_rsa key found, generate one? (y/n) y

****************************************************************************
*     GitHub highly recommends you use a strong passphrase on your key     *

****************************************************************************

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/tekkub/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/tekkub/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
67:f1:d6:da:55:22:e0:7f:22:f5:47:f1:16:a6:59:fc tekkub@gmail.com
Upload id_rsa key to your github account? (y/n) y</pre>

Msysgit (windows) users will be presented with an extra option, since ssh-agent doesn't load by default in msysgit:

<pre>You appear to be running Msysgit, would you like to use the ssh-agent loader?
This script will load ssh-agent to save your passphrase so that you don't need
to re-enter the passphrase every time you use your ssh key.

Install script to your .bashrc file? (y/n) y
Script installed, you will need to re-open git bash to load your key.
